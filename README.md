# Gifstronomic
A simple app that uses the Giphy API to find gifs based on search terms.

## Author
Madeleine Griggs.

## About this Project
this is an app for retriving gifs from the Giphy API, and displaying them. There are several buttons with food themed words, and the user can click on one of them to search for that word through Giphy, and then displaying 10 gifs from that category.

The user can also add new buttons, so they can search for other gifs. They may also save gifs that they like, and check them out in the "favorite gifs" section. This section persists by using local storage to store the favourited gifs.

This project was written using: HTML5, CSS3, jQuery 3.4.1, and Javascript. It also uses the Giphy API.
